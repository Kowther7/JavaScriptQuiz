# Kowther's JavScript Quiz Application

This is a straightforward quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It tests the user's JavaScript knowledge within a 60-second timeframe. Correct answers earn the user 1 point, while incorrect ones deduct 10 seconds from the remaining time. Additionally, the user can store their initials and score via localStorage, allowing them to view their high score after completing the quiz.
